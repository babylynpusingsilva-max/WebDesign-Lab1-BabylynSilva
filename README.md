1. What is a website, and how is it different from a web application?

A website is a collection of web pages that share information with visitors. It is mostly informational, like a blog, portfolio, or school site. A web application, however, is interactive and allows users to perform specific tasks. For example, Gmail or online banking systems let users log in, send data, and get personalized results.In short, a website mainly shows information, while a web application lets users interact with the system and perform actions.

2. Why do you think organizations (like offices or schools) need websites?

Organizations need websites because they serve as their digital presence. A website helps build credibility and trust, provides information about services or events, and improves communication through announcements or contact forms. It also ensures accessibility, allowing people to get information anytime, and promotes engagement by sharing news, achievements, and updates. In essence, a website helps an organization reach more people and operate more efficiently.

3. What challenges did you encounter while creating your first repository?

When I created my first repository, I learned how to use Git commands like commit, push, and dealing with errors while connecting to GitHub (for example, authentication problems). Organizing project files properly, understanding how to write a README, and managing branches or merge conflicts can also be tricky at first.

4. How might this practice of documentation (README) help in future projects?

Writing documentation, especially a README file, is extremely helpful. It clearly explains what your project is, how to use it, and how itâ€™s structured. This makes it easier for others and my future self to understand the project quickly. It also improves collaboration, maintainability, and overall professionalism.
